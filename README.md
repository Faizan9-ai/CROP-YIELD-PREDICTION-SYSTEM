# CROP-YIELD-PREDICTION-SYSTEM
Crop Yield Prediction System is a machine learning-based project designed to help farmers and agricultural organizations forecast crop production. The system uses historical data such as weather conditions, soil quality, rainfall, and other environmental factors to predict the expected yield of different crops.

# Project Overview
The **Crop Yield Prediction System** is a machine learning-based project that predicts agricultural crop production using environmental and historical data. It leverages parameters such as **soil type, rainfall, temperature, fertilizer usage, and past yields** to forecast crop productivity.  By applying regression and ensemble learning models like **Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Linear Regression**, the system helps farmers, researchers, and policymakers make informed decisions to optimize resources, plan cultivation strategies, and ensure sustainable agriculture. 

# Features
1. Predicts crop yield using historical and environmental data  
2. Considers factors such as soil type, rainfall, temperature, and fertilizer use  
3. Implements machine learning models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Linear Regression)  
4. Provides a user-friendly web interface (Flask/Django) for real-time predictions  
5. Supports sustainable farming practices and efficient resource allocation

# Tech Stack used in this Project
  **Python**: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
  **Machine Learning**: Regression & Ensemble Models  
  **Flask/Django**: Web deployment  
  **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
